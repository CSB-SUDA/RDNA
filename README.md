Differential Network Analysis Reveals the ECM-receptor as a Central Biological Hub for Alpha Particle-induced Malignant Transformation


Space particle radiation is a major environmental factor in spaceflight, and it is known to cause body damage and even trigger cancer, but with unknown molecular etiologies. To reveal these causes, we proposed a systems biology analytical approach that included co-expression network analysis of transcriptomics profiles with different alpha particle radiation environments (single high-dose irradiation/a single dose of  0.5 Gy for one time, and multiple low-dose irradiation/irradiated with 0.02 Gy once every three days for 25 exposures) on human bronchial epithelial cells and differential network comparative analysis from different levels. Overall pathway analysis based on the global network and the core modules both showed that genes in the multiple low-dose irradiation group had higher significant enrichment for the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. Then, COL1A1 was screened as an important ECM-related gene in the multiple low-dose irradiation group by the network robustness parameters, as well as the expression study of lung adenocarcinoma TNM samples from the TCGA database. The functional role of COL1A1 was further verified by a series of experiments including qRT-PCR, Western blot, cellular immunofluorescence, tissue microarray, immunohistochemistry, cell scratching and transwell invasion assays. These findings suggested that the degree of malignant transformation of cells after multiple low-dose irradiations was higher than that of a single high-dose irradiation, which may be caused by the dysregulation of the ECM-receptor pathway. This study provides information on molecular mechanisms of multiple low-dose irradiations to mimic spaceflight, using a combination of high throughput RNA-sequencing-based transcriptomics and systems biology approaches.
